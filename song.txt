[Intro]
Ahh!

[Verse 1]
A crusade, a call to the brave
A mission, a mark on our name
Hold hope in a world of doubt
Full of war, chains unbound
Revolting, the silent scream now
Refusing, to lose, to lie down
Hold hope in a world of shame
In the end they’ll know our name

[Pre-Chorus]
Day after day we burn, a new light
We’re climbing the mountain
Victory in sight!

[Chorus]
A movement, connected
Our voices rise above the flames
Redeemed in the ashes
We’re staring down the face of hate

[Verse 2]
An evil that only knows pain
They’re broken and leading the way
Heretics with an axe to clutch
Crush the truth
Turn it to dust
[Pre-Chorus]
They’ve got our souls in the palm of their hands
But with strength like mountains
We’ll take them back again

[Chorus]
A movement, connected
Our voices rise above the flames
Redeemed in the ashes
We’re staring down the face of hate
A movement, connected
Our voices rise above the flames
Redeemed in the ashes
We’re staring down the face of hate

[Outro]
A crusade
A call to the brave
A mission
A mark on our name
We’re staring down the face of hate!
Of hate
We’re staring down the face of hate!
